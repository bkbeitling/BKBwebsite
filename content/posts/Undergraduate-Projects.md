At Truman State University, I completed a Bachelor of Science in both economics and psychology as well as minors in statistics (theoretical), statistical methods (applied), and mathematics. Several papers written for courses completed during that undergraduate program are detailed below.  
   
### [St. Louis Encephalitis Project](https://github.com/bkbeitling/OldProjects/blob/9a348920b6e7fa2648d84834fc076850a02ee6f7/Undergrad/StLouisEncephalitisProject.pdf)
**Course:** Introduction to Mathematical Biology  
**Summary:** Environmental data (atmospheric and wildlife populations) were used to model and predict the incidence of St. Louis Encephalitis in Texas.  
**Statistical methods and keywords:** multiple linear regression, simple linear regression, polynomial regression, standardized variables, prediction, multicollinearity, backward elimination  
**Software:** SPSS, Excel  
  
### [Antidepressant Sales and the Health of the Economy Capstone](https://github.com/bkbeitling/OldProjects/blob/9a348920b6e7fa2648d84834fc076850a02ee6f7/Undergrad/Antidepressant%20Sales%20Capstone.pdf)
**Course:** Senior Seminar in Economics  
**Summary:** Antidepressant drug sales and economic factors in Norway were examined to determine whether antidepressant drugs act similar to inferior goods (that is, sales increase during economic hardship).    
**Statistical methods and keywords:** multiple linear regression, simple linear regression, polynomial regression, multicollinearity, heteroscedasticity, positive autocorrelation, Durbin-Watson, Klein's Rule of Thumb   
**Software:** SHAZAM, SPSS  
  
### [Relationship between Parenting Style and Academic Performance Capstone](https://github.com/bkbeitling/OldProjects/blob/9a348920b6e7fa2648d84834fc076850a02ee6f7/Undergrad/Parenting%20Style%20Capstone.pdf)
**Course:** Psychological Research    
**Summary:** Sessions were conducted to collect student data regarding parenting style (of their parents) using a survey instrument as well as academic performance as measured by GRE questions. Results were examined to investigate the relationship between parenting style and academic performance.  
**Statistical methods and keywords:** reliability, validity, internal consistency, ANOVA, main effects, interaction effects, t-test   
**Software:** SPSS  
  
### [Students' Perceptions of Writing-Enhanced Courses at Truman State University](https://github.com/bkbeitling/OldProjects/blob/9a348920b6e7fa2648d84834fc076850a02ee6f7/Undergrad/Writing%20Enhanced%20Report.pdf)
**Course:** Nonparametric Statistics/Sampling  
**Summary:** A survey instrument was designed to gather data on students' experiences with courses designated "writing-enhanced" (that is, with a significant writing component) at Truman State University to determine how well-aligned student perceptions of their writing-enhanced course experiences were to the stated university goals for writing-enhanced courses.  
**Statistical methods and keywords:** descriptive statistics, correlation, nonparametric, Kruskal-Wallace, Mann-Whitney, Wilcoxon, Kendall's tau, Spearman's rho, ANOVA, binomial test  
**Software:** SPSS
